Redesigning a health care website for old people
This project aims for redesigning the Andhra Pradesh Healthcare website for
older people. The actual website is not having an aesthetic and minimalist
design, which is a needed factor for a website. It is also not user-friendly
(especially for old people). To overcome these problems we redesigned the
actual website into a simpler one which provides all the information about
healthcare. It includes the basic benefit schemes introduced by the Andhra
Pradesh government and also allows users to make appointments.
